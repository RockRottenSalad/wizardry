A toolbox with types/functions I often need for C projects.
<br>
Far from finished, just started working on this :)

## Progress
- Generic dynamic list type is mostly finished, just needs a few more QOL functions and polish(+ error handling)
- Linked list is almost finished
- Working on hashmap
- Thinking about how to implement a consistent way of doing error handling

### Last push
- Progress on hashmap


## Ideas
Just some general things I'm thinking about implementing
- String type for easy concatting, tokenizing  etc.
- Build C with C! Throw in a sub-module that can be used as a simple build system [wiz_build](https://github.com/RockRottenSalad/wiz-build/)
- Find out what else to put here
