A toolbox with types/functions I often need for C projects.
<br>
Far from finished, just started working on this :)

## Progress
- Generic dynamic list type is mostly finished, just needs a few more QOL functions and polish
- Just started working on linked list, but since it's a simple data structure it won't take long to finish implementing

## Ideas
Just some general things I'm thinking about implementing
- String type for easy concatting, tokenizing  etc.
- Build C with C! Throw in a sub-module that can be used as a simple build system
- Find out what else to put here
